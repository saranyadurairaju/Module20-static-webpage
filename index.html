    <h2 style="color: rgb(18, 18, 19)"><b>Overview</b></h2>
    <p><small>Agriculture is responsible for one-third of non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world. 
        Changing agricultural practices and shifting to a diet that's devoid of meat and dairy products 
        could reduce the Emission. While there is much less methane and N2O in the atmosphere, 
        these gases have different capacities to trap heat. As a result, they are assessed using 
        Global Warming Potential, which compares the ability of 1 kg of each gas to trap heat 
        over a 100-year time horizon. Using this measure, methane has 25 times the warming 
        potential of CO2, and N2O 298 times higher than CO2.</small></p>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(18, 18, 19)"><b>Items Contributing to Emission</b></h2>
    <p><small>Agricultural activities like crop and livestock production for food 
        contribute to emissions in a variety of ways: Some of the items that contribute to N2O emissions 
        from agricultural lands include Manure Management, Synthetic Fertilizers, Manure applied to Soils, 
        Manure left on Pasture, Crop Residues, Burning - Crop residues, Land Use change, Drained organic soils
        (N2O), Savanna fires, Forest fires and On-farm energy use.</small></p>
     <p><small>Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, produce methane (CH4) as part of their normal 
        digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and other Items such as Manure 
        Management, Rice Cultivation, Burning - Crop residues, Land Use change, Savanna fires, Forest fires,
        Fires in organic soils and On-farm energy use.</small></p>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(18, 18, 19)"><b>Machine Learning</b></h2>
    <p><small>Machine learning (ML) models are used to study complex environmental phenomena with high 
        variability. In our ML model we are going to analyze Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions 
        as it contributes more on Agriculture and Forest land emissions. We are doing Linear Regression model 
        to Analyze our data deeply in both categories as well as the world data. </small></p>

        </figure>
        <br>  
       <p><small>As the prediction of future Emission depends on many factors like soil temperature, air moisture, 
           Volumetric Water Content(VWC), we are classifying the Emission values into different Zones for N2O & CH4 
           Elements. Data Preprocessing include steps like Categorizing (Element, Item, Year, Population, Emission) 
           features, Classifying the Target variable (Zones into four different categories like Red, Orange, Yellow 
           and Green), which intern called Multiclass classification.</small></p> 
    <h3 style="color: rgb(18, 18, 19)"><b>Classification Algorithms</b></h3>
    <p><small>Logistic regression is a simple yet very effective classification algorithm. Multinomial 
        logistic regression is an extension of logistic regression that adds native support for multi-class 
        classification problems. And its always good to try multiple models to compare the results. So, the Random
        Forest works well as it reduces overfitting in decision trees and helps to improve the accuracy. 
        It is also flexible to both classification and regression problems and works well with both categorical 
        and continuous values.</small></p>
    <p> Below diagram shows the Accuracy score and other Results:</p>
        <figure>
              <p><img src="Images/ML_Model_Results.png" height="250px" />
          </figure>
    <pre><b>The results show that the Logistic Regression Algorithm classifies the Emission more accurately than Random Forest Classifier. Since our data is Skewed (Stratify was used) and Imbalanced which results in more number of items in specific categories. 
            This might be the reason that our Logistic performed better than the Random Forest. Also, Logistic regression performs better when the number of noise variables is less than or equal to the number of explanatory variables. 
            (Noise variables - Difficult or impossible to control; Explanatory Variable - manipulated in an experiment by a researcher). However the Data is classified perfectly according to the Emission and lets aim for all the countries in Zone 0 (Green).

    Time to think of the ways to reduce the greenhouse gas emission for a safer and a better future.
